# Restaurant Johnie
Welcome to the code repository for Restaurant Johnie, the delightful virtual dining experience crafted during my journey learning HTML and CSS. This project represents not only my growth as a developer but also my passion for creating responsive and aesthetically pleasing web designs.

# About the Project
Restaurant Johnie is a conceptual model of a restaurant website, built to showcase a responsive design that adapts seamlessly across different devices. The project encapsulates the core aspects of a restaurant's online presence, featuring five distinct pages:

- Home: The welcoming front page that introduces visitors to Restaurant Johnie.
- Menu: A mouthwatering display of the dishes available, complete with descriptions and pricing.
- About Us: Sharing the story of Restaurant Johnie, its values, and its commitment to an exceptional dining experience.
- Location: Detailed address information, helping guests to find the restaurant with ease.
- Reservations: An interface for booking a table. (Note: The booking feature is currently not set up to handle real reservations.)

## Features
- Responsive Design: Built from the ground up to ensure a smooth experience on all devices, whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
- Interactive Elements: Enhanced with JavaScript, the website now includes visual animations that engage users as they navigate through the site.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: The backbone of the website, constructing the content and structure.
- CSS: Bringing life to the HTML with colors, layouts, and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Adding interactive and animated elements to increase user engagement.

## Development
This project was developed with a focus on creating a functional and responsive design. Initial versions were static, later evolving to include dynamic elements as my proficiency with JavaScript grew. It is an ongoing project that I plan to enhance as I learn new technologies and design techniques.

## Future Enhancements
- Real Booking System: Integration of a backend system to handle real-time table reservations.
- Customer Reviews: A section for diners to leave reviews about their experiences.
- Online Ordering: Functionality for users to order food directly from the website.

## Feedback
I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement! Please feel free to fork the project, submit a pull request, or send me your thoughts and ideas.

Thank you for visiting Restaurant Johnie!
